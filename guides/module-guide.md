> *Modules are the building blocks of the Litsignal platform.*

They, in turn, are composed of any combination of these components:
- *References*
- *README*
- *Attachments*
- *Podcast episode*
- *Embedded video*
 
The official Litsignal opinion is that **a module should be a clear expression of a single concept**. There is no need to cram all of your ideas into one module. Instead, use container modules, like this one, to encapsulate broader concepts. Composable modules are easier to maintain, leverage and share. 
 
That said, there are no absolute rules* governing how you author your modules. Feel free to get creative with the platform and use your modules to:
- create an open source curriculum
- organize a journal club
- archive lectures
- share anything you think is cool, even if it's not bioscientific
 
*This isn't entirely true. There are some very reasonable community standards that you can review in the site policy documents. Don't be a gross jerk, and you should be fine.

### References

References are the core components of every module. The best module for a particular topic, in fact, might be a short list of journal articles. In other cases, references may just provide additional background. Litsignal supports these 4 different reference types:
- journal articles
- books
- links
- modules

[Visit the **References**](/litsignal/references) module to learn more about how to import references and include them in your modules.

### README

READMEs have a long history in software engineering, but you can think of them as the entry point to a module. Use a README to summarize a concept, emphasize a particular reference, or provide a comprehensive discussion of a topic. Plain text is just fine, but formatting can be added with [*Markdown*](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), a readable and ubiquitous markup language for the web.

[Visit the **README**](/litsignal/readme-guide) module to learn more about how to make the most of yours.

### Attachments

Attachment uploads allow modules to include files that would not otherwise be available through linking, such as PDF documents and slides. As always, care must be taken not to share protected content, such as copyrighted full text journal articles. Copyright infringement will not be tolerated. As a rule, unless the resource has been created by the module author it shouldn't be included as an attachment. In all other cases, link to the owner or publisher, or get permission for unrestricted sharing from the owner.

[Visit the **Attachments**](/litsignal/attachments) module to learn more.

### Podcast episodes

Each Litsignal account also optionally functions as a personal podcast host. By default the podcast feature is disabled, but activation is as simple as checking a box and uploading an audio file. Each podcast episode is part of a module. The module's description, README, and other attributes determine how the podcast feed is assembled. Litsignal podcasts are automatically submitted to iTunes, allowing listeners to discover and playback episodes with ease.

[Visit the **Podcasting**](/litsignal/podcasting) module to learn more about how to get started.

### Embedded video

Embedded YouTube videos, whether long form presentations or brief explainers, can significantly enhance any module. 

[Visit the **Video**](/litsignal/video) module to learn how to embed your first video.
