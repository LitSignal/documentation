# What is a module?
## Modules are the core components of Litsignal. The module ecosystem supports everything from a simple module that clearly communicates a single idea to a complex module that encapsulates an entire curriculum. Individual modules may contain any of the following components: references, README, attachments, audio, and video.
## References
References are the core components of every module. For some modules, in fact, the best module will be a short list of journal articles. For others references may just provide additional background. Regardless, every module must contain at least one reference. Litsignal supports 4 different reference types: journal articles, books, links, and modules.

## README
Borrowing a convention from open source software, the README should be treated as the entry point for the module. It can be anything from a brief description to a comprehensive summary. README documents can be Markdown-formatted or plain text. In addition, special extensions allow the embedding of mathematical notation and diagrams. Follow these links to learn more about README, Markdown, JAX, and UML.

## Attachments
Attachment uploads allow modules to include files that would not otherwise be available through linking, such as PDF documents and slides. As always, care must be taken not to share protected content, such as full text journal articles. As a rule, unless the resource has been created by the module author it shouldn't be included as an attachment. In all other cases, an effort should be made to link to rather than attach the content.

## Audio
Each user has the ability to host a podcast right from within Litsignal. Entering the podcast details on the profile page enables the podcast, and uploading audio to modules transforms them into podcast episodes. Litsignal podcasts are automatically listed on iTunes, allowing listeners to discover and subscribe to them using standard podcast players.

## Video
Although it's not possible to upload video files to modules, it is possible to embed video from other sources like YouTube. Whether long form presentations or brief explainers, videos can significantly enhance any module.
