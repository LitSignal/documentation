# It could be said that scientific publishing was the original open source movement.

Although open source is a relatively new term, the idea of openly sharing information goes back to the origins of humanity and was academically formalized hundreds of years ago. Unfortunately, while the rate of publication has increased exponentially, the ability of individual learners to digest new knowledge has remained relatively static. The gap between discovery and understanding will continue to grow until we have the capability to match the growth of content with the ability to comprehend it at the same scale.

Litsignal is designed to meet the needs of filtering, aggregating, annotating, summarizing, synthesizing, and critiquing scientific publications through community contributions using a platform inspired by the open source software movement.

Open source software has achieved explosive growth and astonishing quality through a combination of principles, processes and tools that make it satisfying and simple to collaborate on solutions to technical problems. It is time to apply those same concepts to the classroom, clinic, and laboratory.

Litsignal provides a welcoming community and simple tools to make it easy to participate in the work of organizing, understanding, sharing, discussing, and shaping the state of scientific knowledge.

Openness and transparency are two of the core values of Litsignal. Basic membership includes generous limits on open content. Paid plans will be available for those individuals and organizations who require private content.
