## User Guidelines
Litsignal.com strongly believes in freedom of speech. We have a vast audience spread across many cultures, countries and backgrounds with varying values and our service is designed to let users freely express any ideas and opinions without us censoring or endorsing them. That being said, there are a few categories of content and behavior that we don’t permit because we consider them harmful to the community.

To be transparent about what is and isn&#8217;t allowed on your site, we’ve put together this set of guidelines. The following activity/material isn’t allowed on Litsignal.com.
---
- **Illegal content and conduct.**  
   Self-explanatory.
- **Intellectual property infringement.**  
   Litsignal.com is an academic resource sharing platform utilizing links to public databases, publisher websites, booksellers, and other publicly available URLs. Please don't share links to protected or restricted resources.
- **Technologically harmful content.**  
   Please don’t upload or link to malware, spyware, adware, or other malicious or destructive code.
- **Impersonation.**  
   Don’t claim to be a person or organization you’re not. Parody and satire are discouraged. Squatting on usernames and organization names will result in account cancellation.
- **Directly threatening material.**  
   We don’t tolerate direct and reamoduleic threats of violence.
- **Posting private information.**  
   Don’t share someone’s personal information without their consent.
- **Advertising.**  
   Disclose conflicts of interests when posting content that could be construed as marketing or product support material.
- **Spam or machine-generated content.**  
   You know what this is, but in general, content that is primarily dedicated to drive traffic to third party sites, boost SEO, phish, spoof, or promote affiliate marketing aren’t cool. We don’t want you to pollute the web outside of Litsignal.com either, so we ask you to please avoid sending unwanted or unsolicited promotions or emails about your site, even if it’s not on Litsignal.com.

Bear in mind that these are just guidelines &#8212; <strong>interpretations are up to us</strong>. These guidelines are not exhaustive and are subject to change.

If you believe a Litsignal.com user has violated our <a href="https://litsignal.com/tos">Terms of Service</a> or any of these policies, please <a href="https://litsignal.com/report-user/">report the user</a>. We review and investigate all complaints that we receive, but if and how we respond will depend on a variety of factors, such as the information available to us and the type of violation. We may also contact the site author to inform him/her of the complaint.

If we&#8217;re not in a position to make a determination (for example, whether something is <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/defamation/">defamatory</a> or not), we defer to the judgment of a court.
