### What is Litsignal?

Litsignal is a biomedical education community built upon a platform for creating and sharing learning modules. Modules are flexible containers for a range of content: references, README, attachments, audio, and video. Modules are also open. Any module you create can be viewed by any other user. There are 3 special built-in modules associated with your account.
- `My Modules` a list of the modules you've authored.
- `Stars` is a list of all of your starred items
- `Library` is a collection of your uploaded PDF documents and their associated references. 
***
### Quick start
- Click on the `Star` button belonging to `Module Guide`.  Congratulations! You just starred your first item.
- Click on the `Add to module` button belonging to `Star Guide`. A form should pop up. Type a title for your new module and submit it. Good job!
***
### Still have questions?
Explore our introductory modules below. You can start with any of them, but you'll want to spend some time with the `Module Guide` eventually if you want to make the most of your Litsignal experience.
