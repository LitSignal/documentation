# Get started
## There are many ways to contribute to the Litsignal community. Here are a few ideas to get you going.
## Upload your library
Upload your full text articles and see how easy it is to declutter your academic life. Experience the lightness of having your entire library at your fingertips.

## Star something
Stars are like bookmarks. Click on Star wherever you see something interesting, and it will be added to your Stars collection. Unstar it later if you change your mind.

## Create a module
There's nothing to it. Just pick an interesting module, follow our guide, and see how easy it can be.
